## **Project Statement**  
Wildfires have devastating environmental, economic, and social impacts, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. Traditional fire detection methods rely on satellite imagery and human monitoring, leading to delays in response times. FireSense aims to develop a **real-time, sensor-based predictive model** that enhances early detection and mitigation efforts, significantly reducing wildfire risks.

---

## **Business Purpose**  
FireSense provides an **AI-driven wildfire risk prediction system** using real-time sensor data to help mitigate disasters before they escalate. It serves:  
- **Government agencies** for disaster prevention  
- **Emergency responders** for timely interventions  
- **Forestry departments** for resource management  
- **Insurance companies** for risk assessment  

By enabling **proactive wildfire management**, FireSense reduces economic losses, safeguards natural resources, and enhances public safety.

---

## **Business Use Case**  
FireSense enables real-time wildfire risk prediction using **sensor data and AI**, helping government agencies, firefighters, and insurers make proactive decisions.  
- Provides **early alerts**, reducing financial losses  
- Protects **ecosystems** and **wildlife**  
- Enhances **disaster preparedness**
